# Scheduler_Engage
A Scheduler Project which is made as a part of Microsoft engage mentorship program.

Idea:
I thought of building a class scheduler, where a student/faculty will be able to signup/login into their account(organization account), and the faculty will be able to 
create a subject room(where he/she will be scheduling a class) similar to the team in the microsoft teams and he/she will be able to add students into the subject room and 
also will be able to schedule a class by providing details like day, time slot, capacity allowed for the offline classroom and students allowed like whether fully vaccinated 
are allowed or partially vaccinated are also allowed(assuming unvaccinated will not be allowed), there will be a calendar which shows the occupied slots and faculty will be 
able to select a slot from the free slots and when a faculty schedules a class, students will get notification of the class and they will be able to select their preference 
and allocation is done based on the 

1)vaccinated status and 
2)time when preference was filled and also 
3)assuming a student can attend a maximum of “n” offline classes, students who already attended “n” online classes will not be able to attend any more offline classes,
in this way all the students can get a chance to attend offline class.

Based on the above constraints students would be allotted offline or online class and they will get a notification regarding the same.

Progress:
The above was my initial idea, but due to time constraints(due to placements), I am unable to completely finish the project, but yet I have done a major part of it(will finish 
it in future), for now I am attaching a video link which shows my progress till date: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHdTinECzqs
